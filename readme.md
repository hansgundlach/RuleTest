# A Study of Faithfulness in LLM Classification 

This is code provided to test the faithfulnes of models in a classification task.  Examples were generated programmaticly using gen_flag_examples, and gen_anagram_example methods in rulepipe.py. rulepipe.py runs most of the experimenets used in our paper. FrozenExamples contains randomly selected classification examples that we think are illustrative.
